    "* Review the academic integrity and collaboration policies on the course\n",
    "website.\n",
    "* This assignment must be completed individually.\n",
    "* All solutions must be written in this notebook.\n",
    "* Math must be done in Markdown/$\\LaTeX$.\n",
    "* You must show your work and describe your solution.\n",
    "* Programming aspects of this assignment must be completed using Python in this notebook.\n",
    "* Your code should be well written with sufficient comments to understand, but there is no need to write extra markdown to describe your solution if it is not explictly asked for.\n",
    "* This notebook contains skeleton code, which should not be modified (this is important for standardization to facilate efficient grading).\n",
    "* You may use python packages for basic linear algebra, but you may not use functions that directly solve the problem. If you are uncertain about using a specific package, function, or method, then please ask the instructional staff whether it is allowable.\n",
    "* **You must submit this notebook as an .ipynb file, a .py file, and a .pdf file on Gradescope.**\n",
    "    - You may directly export the notebook as a .py file.  You may use [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to convert the .ipynb file to a .py file using the following command\n",
    "    `jupyter nbconvert --to script filename.ipynb`\n",
    "    - There are two methods to convert the notebook to a .pdf file.\n",
    "        - You may first export the notebook as a .html file, then print the web page as a .pdf file.\n",
    "        - If you have XeTeX installed, then you may directly export the notebook as a .pdf file.  You may use [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to convert a .ipynb file to a .pdf file using the following command\n",
    "        `jupyter nbconvert --allow-chromium-download --to webpdf filename.ipynb`\n",
    "    - **You must ensure the contents in each cell (e.g., code, output images, printed results, etc.) are clearly visible, and are not cut off or partially cropped in the .pdf file.**\n",
    "    - Your code and results must remain inline in the .pdf file (do not move your code to an appendix).\n",
    "    - **While submitting on gradescope, you must assign the relevant pages in the .pdf file submission for each problem.**\n",
    "* It is highly recommended that you begin working on this assignment early."
